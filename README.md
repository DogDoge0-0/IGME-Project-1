<summary>Market Research and Need Analysis</summary>
<br>
Our idea is to present the average person with recipes that will help them create simple and easy meals that don’t have too many ingredients or steps, and with low prep time. After looking at many surveys it is clear that most people narrow down their search for recipes based on how complex the recipe is, as most people with average levels of skill won’t be looking for a crazy recipe with 40 ingredients and 10 hours of prep time. Another important factor is how people are searching for their recipes, as the majority of people are using a search engine and not social media websites. This means that our website will need to be visible on search engines and that will be our main consumer base. A final important thing is that most people are just looking for a recipe and not much else. This means we need to focus on the quality of the recipes on our website, as having good recipes will have much more of an impact than having alright recipes with tips or FAQ or videos. 
While many websites exist on the internet that give simple recipes, I think that providing a website that is completely focused on creating a simple and efficient way to find simple recipes will stand out. Most websites have recipes but are also filled with other features that most consumers are not really very concerned with. By providing a simple, no-nonsense way of finding recipes without going through all the hassle of watching a video, or scrolling through long arduous steps, or dealing with having to shop for super niche ingredients that you won’t find in a grocery store, our website will stand out against all the other websites on the market.

<summary>Product Description</summary>
<br>
This website features many standard features found across many of the websites people visit every day, to make the swap from one recipe website to another. These features are: A navigation bar, to allow for easy access to many of the main pages. A search function, which is specific to the page you are on, meaning if you are viewing a recipe, the search will search for recipes, but if they are viewing an ingredient, it will search for ingredients. Users can also favorite recipes that they would like to make again, for easy access right on the recipe main page. A tagging system allows people who post recipes to specify exactly what their recipe is. They could tag a pizza recipe for Italian, pizza, tomatoes, etc. All recipes will also allow users to post ratings on how good the recipe was, with the obligatory reporting feature to prevent trolls.
The website’s UI is designed to be simplistic and easy to use, to allow for users who would like to migrate from an existing recipe website to food avenue in a seamless manner. The UI is meant to be modern and simple, preventing any new users from getting overwhelmed like some of the competitors websites have. Note the popup on load, the intrusive advertising and the auto playing videos. 
This website features two innovations. They are: *Links to each ingredient*, using affiliate links when possible, to make a small commission from online ordering of ingredients. Secondly, This website will allow the user to *search for ingredient combinations*, so if they don’t have many ingredients at their disposal, they can find something to make using what they currently have.

<summary>Possible Problems and Counterarguments
</summary>
<br>
Websites do exist that have our exact idea and some of them are proficient in doing what my group has set out to do. One problem that could arise is getting the websites and IP’s needed for people to order all of the ingredients, that’s a lot of paperwork and talking too before we can even start fully making the product.  The main issue I see as of now can be overcomed through patience and negotiation and as for how we can stay relevant. Our product mainly focuses on quick and cheap meals that appeal to the everyday busy person. So with enough time and advertising, I am fully confident our product can rise to the challenge.

<summary>Conclusion and Recommendations</summary>
<br>
Food Avenue gives its users a menagerie of recipes to dabble in, working to raise the general cooking skill of all those who use our website, but also making getting ingredients incredibly easier and efficient. This is increasingly helpful for those who lack a proper cooking know-how, since there’s plenty of recipes to practice with. The development of this website could greatly impact the issue of world hunger by raising culinary expertise worldwide, as well as making ingredients and foodstuffs more accessible online. It gives users new recipes to try, cheap ingredients to buy, and even recipes to choose from based on what you already have, if you need something quick. As such, this website should most definitely be pushed forward into fruition.
